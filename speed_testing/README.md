## üéØ Usage Guide

### Internet Speed Testing

1. **Official Speedtest** (Recommended):
   - Click "üöÄ Official Speedtest" for most accurate results
   - Uses the same engine as speedtest.net website
   - Best for gigabit connections and professional testing

2. **Server Selection**:
   - Choose "Auto-select Best Server" for optimal performance
   - Select specific servers (Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft) for consistency
   - Server affects latency and routing paths

3. **Built-in Tests** (Fallback):
   - Use "Test Download" and "Test Upload" when CLI unavailable
   - Provides basic speed estimation
   - Shows realistic speed variations

### Latency Testing

1. **Ping Tests**:
   - Click "Test Latency" to ping selected server
   - Shows average, minimum, and maximum ping times
   - Quality assessment: Excellent (<20ms), Good (<50ms), Fair (<100ms), Poor (>100ms)

### LAN Speed Testing

1. **Setup**:
   - Enter target device IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
   - Specify port number (default: 12345)
   - Ensure target device has a service running on that port

2. **Common Ports to Try**:
   - Port 22: SSH service
   - Port 80: HTTP web server
   - Port 443: HTTPS web server
   - Port 445: SMB file sharing
   - Port 21: FTP service

3. **Results**:
   - Shows connection latency and estimated speed
   - Provides network type information
   - Quality ratings based on performance

### Understanding Results

#### Speed Displays
- **Download Speed**: How fast you can download data from the internet
- **Upload Speed**: How fast you can upload data to the internet
- **Latency**: Round-trip time for data packets (lower is better)

#### Performance Ratings
- **üöÄ Excellent**: >700 Mbps download (gigabit performance)
- **‚úÖ Good**: 500-700 Mbps (high-speed broadband)
- **‚ö° Decent**: 100-500 Mbps (standard broadband)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Below Expected**: <100 Mbps (may indicate issues)

#### LAN Quality Ratings
- **‚ö° Excellent**: <1ms latency (very fast local network)
- **‚úÖ Good**: 1-5ms latency (fast local network)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Average**: 5-20ms latency (standard network)
- **üêå Slow**: >20ms latency (slow connection or network issues)

## üîß Configuration

### Server Selection
- **Auto-select**: Automatically chooses the best server based on location and latency
- **Cloudflare**: Global CDN with excellent performance worldwide
- **Google**: Reliable global infrastructure with consistent results
- **Microsoft**: Good for testing Microsoft 365 and Azure connectivity

### LAN Testing Setup
For accurate LAN testing, ensure the target device has a service running:

```bash
# Example: Start a simple HTTP server on target device
python -m http.server 8000  # Python 3
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000  # Python 2

# Then test from this app using port 8000
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Speedtest CLI Issues

#### "CLI not found"
- **Solution**: Install speedtest-cli: `pip install speedtest-cli`
- **Alternative**: Click "üì• Install CLI" for platform-specific instructions
- **Fallback**: Use built-in tests for basic speed estimation

#### "Connection failed"
- **Check internet connection**: Verify basic connectivity
- **Firewall issues**: Ensure speedtest traffic is allowed
- **Server problems**: Try different server selection
- **Network restrictions**: Some corporate networks block speedtest

#### "JSON parsing error"
- **Update CLI**: `pip install --upgrade speedtest-cli`
- **Try different server**: Some servers may have compatibility issues
- **Check CLI version**: Run `speedtest-cli --version` in terminal

### LAN Testing Issues

#### "Port closed" or "Connection refused"
- **Start service**: Ensure target device has service running on specified port
- **Try common ports**: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 445 (SMB)
- **Check firewall**: Target device firewall may be blocking connections
- **Verify IP**: Ensure target IP address is correct and reachable

#### "Invalid IP address"
- **Format check**: Use proper IPv4 format (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
- **Network range**: Ensure IP is in your local network range
- **Connectivity**: Try pinging the IP first: `ping 192.168.1.100`

### General Issues

#### Application won't start
- **Python version**: Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
- **PyQt5 missing**: Install with `pip install PyQt5`
- **Permission issues**: Try running as administrator/sudo

#### Slow performance
- **Close other apps**: Stop bandwidth-heavy applications during testing
- **Network congestion**: Test during off-peak hours
- **Multiple tests**: Run several tests for average results
- **CLI preferred**: Use official CLI for best performance
