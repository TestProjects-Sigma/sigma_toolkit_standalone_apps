## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Network Security
- **Read-only Operations**: Application only performs diagnostic tests, never modifies network settings
- **Port Scanning Ethics**: Use port scanning responsibly and only on networks you own or have permission to test
- **Firewall Interaction**: Some tests may trigger firewall alerts or logging

### Privileges
- **Standard User**: Most functions work with standard user privileges
- **Administrator Mode**: Enhanced port scanning capabilities with elevated privileges
- **Network Access**: Requires outbound internet access for external IP detection

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Command not found" errors
- **Windows**: Ensure Windows is up to date (ping, tracert commands)
- **Linux/macOS**: Install network utilities if missing: `sudo apt-get install iputils-ping traceroute`

#### Port scanning limitations
- **Firewall blocking**: Local firewall may block outbound connections
- **Timeout issues**: Increase timeout or reduce port range for slow networks
- **Permission errors**: Run as administrator for enhanced scanning capabilities

#### External IP detection fails
- **Internet connectivity**: Verify internet access is available
- **Firewall restrictions**: Ensure outbound HTTPS traffic is allowed
- **Proxy settings**: Configure proxy if required for internet access

#### DNS lookup failures
- **DNS server issues**: Try alternative DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)
- **Network connectivity**: Verify basic network connectivity first
- **Domain validity**: Ensure the domain name is spelled correctly

### Performance Optimization
- **Large port scans**: Use smaller ranges or scan during off-peak hours
- **Network latency**: Expect slower results on high-latency connections
- **Resource usage**: Close other network-intensive applications during testing
