# SMTP Tester - Python Dependencies
# Standalone SMTP testing tool requirements

# GUI Framework
PyQt5==5.15.10

# Core Python libraries (usually included with Python)
# These are listed for completeness but typically don't need to be installed separately:
# - smtplib (built-in)
# - socket (built-in) 
# - ssl (built-in)
# - threading (built-in)
# - time (built-in)
# - subprocess (built-in)
# - platform (built-in)
# - email.mime.text (built-in)
# - email.mime.multipart (built-in)
# - datetime (built-in)
# - sys (built-in)
# - os (built-in)

# Alternative PyQt5 installation options:
# If PyQt5==5.15.10 doesn't work on your system, try:
# PyQt5>=5.12.0
# 
# For older systems, you might need:
# PyQt5==5.12.3

# Development and Testing (optional)
# pytest>=6.0.0
# pytest-qt>=4.0.0

# Notes:
# - This application only requires PyQt5 as an external dependency
# - All other functionality uses Python's built-in libraries
# - PyQt5 provides the GUI framework for the application interface
# - The SMTP functionality uses Python's standard smtplib module
# - DNS lookups use subprocess to call system DNS tools (nslookup/dig)
