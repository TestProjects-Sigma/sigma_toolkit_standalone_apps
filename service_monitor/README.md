- **Service Name**: Descriptive identifier for each monitored endpoint
- **Status**: Current health status with visual indicators
- **Response Time**: Latest response time in milliseconds
- **Last Checked**: Timestamp of most recent monitoring check
- **Details**: Additional information about service status or errors

### Console Output

- **Timestamp**: Precise timing for all logged events
- **Log Levels**: INFO, SUCCESS, WARNING, ERROR, and DEBUG messages
- **Debug Mode**: Toggle for detailed troubleshooting information

## üîß Configuration Management

### Saving Configurations

```bash
File ‚Üí Save Configuration
# Creates timestamped JSON file with all service definitions
# Format: service_config_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
```

### Loading Configurations

```bash
File ‚Üí Load Configuration
# Options to replace existing services or merge with current setup
# Supports standard JSON configuration format
```

### Auto-save Functionality

- **Automatic Persistence**: Configurations automatically saved to `service_config.json`
- **Session Recovery**: Previous monitoring setup restored on application startup
- **Change Tracking**: Configuration updates saved when services are added or removed

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

### Service Monitoring Strategy
- **Start with Critical Services**: Add your most important infrastructure first
- **Use Categories**: Organize services logically for easier management
- **Enable Auto-refresh**: Set up continuous monitoring for proactive issue detection
- **Regular Testing**: Manually test services periodically to validate monitoring accuracy

### Performance Optimization
- **Reasonable Service Count**: Monitor essential services to avoid overwhelming the system
- **Network Considerations**: Account for network latency in response time expectations
- **Timeout Settings**: Default 10-second timeout balances accuracy with responsiveness
- **Monitoring Intervals**: 30-second auto-refresh provides good balance of timeliness and system load

### Operational Guidelines
- **Document Configurations**: Export and version control your monitoring configurations
- **Share Configurations**: Use save/load functionality to distribute monitoring setups
- **Monitor Monitoring**: Watch console output for monitoring system health
- **Regular Reports**: Export status reports for trend analysis and documentation

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Connection Failed" or "Timeout" Errors
- **Network Connectivity**: Verify network access to monitored services
- **Firewall Rules**: Ensure outbound connections are allowed
- **Service Availability**: Confirm target services are actually running
- **URL Format**: Verify correct URL format (include http:// or https://)

#### Services Show as Critical When They're Working
- **Response Time**: Service may be responding slowly (> 1000ms)
- **SSL Issues**: Try HTTP instead of HTTPS for internal services
- **Authentication**: Some services may require authentication
- **Endpoint Validity**: Verify the monitored endpoint actually provides status information

#### Auto-refresh Not Working
- **Checkbox Status**: Ensure "Auto-refresh (30s)" is checked
- **Application Focus**: Auto-refresh continues even when application is in background
- **System Resources**: Very high system load may affect timer precision

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed troubleshooting:
1. Click "Toggle Debug" button or use Tools ‚Üí Toggle Debug Mode
2. Review detailed logging in console output
3. Check network requests, response details, and timing information
4. Export console output for analysis or support requests

### Performance Issues

- **Reduce Service Count**: Monitor fewer services if experiencing slowdowns
- **Disable Auto-refresh**: Turn off auto-refresh during troubleshooting
- **Check Network**: Verify network connectivity and DNS resolution
- **System Resources**: Monitor CPU and memory usage during large-scale monitoring

## üîÑ Integration Capabilities

### API Usage (Programmatic Access)

The ServiceTools class can be used programmatically:

```python
from main import ServiceTools, Logger

# Initialize monitoring
logger = Logger()
service_tools = ServiceTools(logger)

# Add services programmatically
service_tools.add_service("Production API", "https://api.company.com/health", "http", "APIs")
service_tools.add_service("Database Server", "db.company.com:5432", "port", "Infrastructure")

# Check all services
service_tools.check_all_services()

# Get status summary
summary = service_tools.get_status_summary()
print(f"Healthy: {summary['healthy']}, Critical: {summary['critical']}")
```

### Configuration File Format

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "Production API",
      "url": "https://api.company.com/health",
      "type": "http",
      "category": "APIs"
    },
    {
      "name": "Database Server",
