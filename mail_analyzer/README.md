## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start Guide

### Getting Email Headers

#### From Gmail:
1. Open the email in Gmail
2. Click the three dots menu (‚ãÆ) next to Reply
3. Select "Show original"
4. Copy the headers from the text that appears

#### From Outlook:
1. Open the email in Outlook
2. Go to File ‚Üí Properties
3. Copy the text from the "Internet headers" box

#### From Thunderbird:
1. Select the email
2. Go to View ‚Üí Message Source (Ctrl+U)
3. Copy the header portion (everything before the blank line)

#### From .eml Files:
1. Save email as .eml file from your email client
2. Use "Upload .eml File" option in the application

### Basic Usage Workflow

1. **Load Headers**: Paste headers or upload .eml file
2. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze Headers" for comprehensive analysis
3. **Authentication**: Use authentication tab for SPF/DKIM/DMARC checking
4. **Delivery Path**: Review routing and timing in delivery path tab
5. **Security**: Check IP reputation and spam indicators
6. **Export**: Save results for documentation and reports

## üìä Understanding Results

### Header Analysis Results

#### Authentication Status Indicators
- **‚úÖ PASS**: Authentication check passed successfully
- **‚ùå FAIL**: Authentication check failed (potential security issue)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è SOFTFAIL**: Authentication check returned soft failure (warning)
- **‚ùì UNKNOWN**: Authentication status could not be determined

#### Delivery Path Analysis
- **Hop Count**: Number of mail servers the email passed through
- **Total Delay**: Time taken for complete email delivery
- **Server Analysis**: Identification of each mail server in the path
- **Timing Issues**: Detection of unusual delays or time regressions

#### Security Assessment
- **üü¢ Low Risk**: Email appears legitimate with proper authentication
- **üü° Medium Risk**: Some security concerns but not necessarily malicious
- **üî¥ High Risk**: Multiple security issues indicating potential threats

### Authentication Records Explained

#### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
- **Purpose**: Validates that sending IP is authorized by domain owner
- **Mechanisms**: Include, A, MX, IP4, IP6 records that authorize senders
- **Policies**: All, ~all (SoftFail), -all (Fail), ?all (Neutral)
- **Result**: Pass/Fail indication for sender IP authorization

#### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
- **Purpose**: Cryptographic signature verification for message integrity
- **Components**: Public key, signature algorithm, signed headers
- **Validation**: Signature verification against DNS-published public key
- **Security**: Ensures message hasn't been tampered with in transit

#### DMARC (Domain Message Authentication)
- **Purpose**: Policy for handling SPF and DKIM authentication failures
- **Policies**: None (monitor), Quarantine (suspicious), Reject (block)
- **Alignment**: How strictly SPF and DKIM must align with From domain
- **Reporting**: Aggregate and forensic reporting for domain owners

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### DNS Server Selection
The application uses system default DNS servers for authentication record lookups. For testing with specific DNS servers, you can:

1. Configure system DNS settings
2. Use VPN or network tools to route DNS queries
3. Test from different network locations for comparison

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode for detailed logging:
1. Click the "Debug" button in the output section
2. Review detailed logs for troubleshooting
3. Copy debug output for technical support

### Custom Analysis Options
- **Delivery Path Display**: Customize timestamp, delay, and server information display
- **Authentication Testing**: Test individual components or run comprehensive analysis
- **Export Formats**: Save results in detailed text format for external analysis

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Email Header Analysis Security
- **Never trust headers alone** - headers can be spoofed or manipulated
- **Verify authentication results** with multiple checks and cross-references
- **Check for consistency** between different header fields and authentication results
- **Monitor for anomalies** in delivery paths and unusual routing patterns

### Authentication Record Security
- **Regular monitoring** of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for unauthorized changes
- **Proper DMARC policies** - move from p=none to p=quarantine/reject when ready
- **Key rotation** for DKIM signatures according to security best practices
- **Monitor DMARC reports** for authentication failures and potential abuse

### Privacy and Data Protection
- **Sensitive information** in headers should be handled according to privacy policies
- **Email content** may contain confidential information - handle appropriately
- **Exported results** contain detailed email routing information - store securely
- **IP addresses** in headers may reveal internal network information

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Unable to resolve DNS records"
- **Check network connectivity** to ensure internet access
- **Verify DNS settings** and try different DNS servers
- **Firewall rules** may be blocking DNS queries
- **Try different domains** to isolate the issue

#### "Invalid email format detected"
- **Ensure complete headers** are copied, including all Received headers
- **Check file encoding** when uploading .eml files
- **Verify header format** matches standard email header structure
- **Try sample headers** to test application functionality

#### "Authentication check timeout"
- **Network latency** may cause DNS lookup delays
- **Firewall restrictions** may block outbound DNS queries
- **DNS server issues** may cause query failures
- **Retry the check** after a brief delay

#### "No delivery path found"
- **Missing Received headers** in the email - some may have been stripped
- **Incomplete headers** copied from email client
- **Internal emails** may have minimal routing information
- **Check different email sources** for comparison

### Performance Optimization
- **Close other applications** for better system performance during analysis
- **Use local DNS cache** for faster repeated queries
- **Process smaller header sets** for testing before full analysis
- **Monitor system resources** during large-scale analysis operations

### Getting Help
1. **Enable debug mode** for detailed error information
2. **Check system requirements** and dependency versions
3. **Test with sample data** to isolate configuration issues
4. **Review network configuration** for DNS and connectivity issues
