# Mail Header Analyzer Requirements
# A comprehensive standalone application for email header analysis and security checking

# Core GUI Framework
PyQt5==5.15.10

# Email Processing and Analysis
# Built-in Python libraries used:
# - email (email header parsing and processing)
# - email.utils (date parsing and address handling)
# - re (regular expression pattern matching)
# - json (configuration and export handling)

# Network and DNS Operations
# Built-in Python libraries used:
# - socket (reverse DNS lookups and basic network operations)
# - subprocess (DNS record queries via nslookup/dig)

# Threading and Async Operations
# Built-in Python libraries used:
# - threading (non-blocking UI operations)
# - time (timing and delay calculations)

# File Operations and System Integration
# Built-in Python libraries used:
# - pathlib (modern path handling)
# - os (file system operations and path management)
# - sys (system-specific parameters and functions)

# Date and Time Processing
# Built-in Python libraries used:
# - datetime (timestamp parsing and formatting)

# Optional Dependencies for Enhanced Functionality

# For advanced DNS operations (optional - provides more robust DNS querying)
# dnspython==2.4.2

# For HTTP-based reputation checking (optional - for web-based IP reputation APIs)
# requests==2.31.0

# For enhanced email file format support (optional - better .msg file handling)
# extract-msg==0.41.1

# For advanced IP address validation and manipulation (optional)
# ipaddress (built-in for Python 3.3+)
