## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Basic Settings

| Setting | Example | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **IP Address** | `127.0.0.1` | Local interface only |
| **IP Address** | `0.0.0.0` | Listen on all network interfaces |
| **Port** | `8080` | Port to listen on (1-65535) |
| **Response Type** | `HTTP OK` | Type of response to send to clients |

### Response Types Explained

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **HTTP OK** | Sends HTTP 200 response with success message | Web browser testing, HTTP health checks |
| **Echo** | Returns received data back to the client | Data transmission testing, protocol validation |
| **Silent** | Accepts connection but sends no response | Stealth monitoring, basic connectivity testing |

## üéØ Usage

### 1. Basic Firewall Testing
1. **Configure Settings**: Enter IP address (use `0.0.0.0` for all interfaces) and port
2. **Select Response Type**: Choose `HTTP OK` for web-based testing
3. **Start Listening**: Click "üöÄ Start Listening" to begin monitoring
4. **Test Externally**: Use tools like `telnet`, `curl`, or web browser to test connectivity
5. **Monitor Results**: Watch the connection log for incoming connections

### 2. Network Connectivity Validation
1. **Set Specific Port**: Choose the port you need to test (e.g., 443 for HTTPS, 80 for HTTP)
2. **Configure Response**: Use `Echo` mode to test data transmission
3. **Monitor Connections**: Track which clients are connecting and when
4. **Validate Firewall Rules**: Confirm that your firewall allows the expected traffic

### 3. Connection Monitoring
1. **Enable Auto-scroll**: Keep the latest connections visible
2. **Show Timestamps**: Track exactly when connections occur
3. **Monitor Statistics**: Watch connection counts and client IPs
4. **Log Analysis**: Review connection patterns for security or troubleshooting

## üß™ Testing Your Listener

### Command Line Testing
```bash
# Test with telnet
telnet your-server-ip 8080

# Test with curl (for HTTP OK response)
curl http://your-server-ip:8080

# Test with netcat
nc your-server-ip 8080
```

### Web Browser Testing
- For HTTP OK response type, simply navigate to: `http://your-server-ip:port`
- You should see "Port test successful!" message

### Network Scanner Testing
```bash
# Test with nmap
nmap -p 8080 your-server-ip

# Test specific port range
nmap -p 8080-8090 your-server-ip
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Failed to start port listener"
- **Solution**: Check if the port is already in use by another application
- **Check**: Use `netstat -an | grep :8080` to see if port is occupied
- **Alternative**: Try a different port number

#### "Port requires administrator privileges"
- **Solution**: Run the application as Administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux/Mac)
- **Cause**: Ports below 1024 are restricted to privileged users
- **Alternative**: Use a port above 1024 (e.g., 8080, 9000)

#### "No connections appearing"
- **Check Firewall**: Ensure Windows Firewall or iptables allows inbound connections
- **Verify IP**: Use `0.0.0.0` to listen on all interfaces
- **Test Locally**: Try connecting from the same machine first
- **Network Access**: Verify external clients can reach your machine

#### "Connection refused" when testing
- **Listener Status**: Ensure the listener is actually running (green status)
- **Correct IP/Port**: Verify you're connecting to the right address and port
- **Network Path**: Check routing and firewall rules between client and server

### Firewall Configuration

#### Windows Firewall
```cmd
# Allow inbound on specific port
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Port Listener Test" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8080

# Remove rule when done
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Port Listener Test"
```

#### Linux iptables
```bash
# Allow inbound on specific port
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT

# Remove rule when done
sudo iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
```

## üí° Use Cases

### Network Infrastructure Testing
- **Firewall Rule Validation**: Verify that firewall rules allow expected traffic
- **Load Balancer Testing**: Confirm load balancers are forwarding traffic correctly
- **Network Segmentation**: Test connectivity between network segments
- **VPN Connectivity**: Validate VPN tunnel functionality

### Security and Monitoring
- **Port Scanning Detection**: Monitor for unauthorized connection attempts
- **Network Reconnaissance**: Identify which systems are attempting connections
- **Security Testing**: Validate that only authorized systems can connect
- **Incident Response**: Monitor specific ports during security investigations

### Development and Testing
- **Application Testing**: Test how applications connect to specific ports
- **Protocol Development**: Test custom network protocols
- **Integration Testing**: Verify system-to-system connectivity
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor connection patterns under load

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Safe Usage
- **Temporary Testing**: Only run the listener when actively testing
- **Specific IP Binding**: Use specific IP addresses rather than 0.0.0.0 when possible
- **Port Selection**: Use non-standard ports to avoid conflicts
- **Monitor Logs**: Review connection logs for unexpected or suspicious activity

### Network Security
- **Firewall Rules**: Create specific firewall rules rather than disabling firewalls
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to the listening port to authorized networks
- **Logging**: Monitor all connections for security purposes
- **Time Limits**: Limit how long the listener runs to minimize exposure

## üìä Understanding Results

### Connection Statistics
- **Connections**: Total number of connection attempts since starting
- **Last**: IP address of the most recent connection
- **Uptime**: How long the listener has been running

### Log Entries
- **Timestamp**: When the connection occurred (if enabled)
- **Client IP**: Source IP address of the connecting client
- **Status Messages**: Startup, shutdown, and error messages

### Response Verification
- **HTTP OK**: Client should receive "Port test successful!" message
- **Echo**: Client should receive back whatever data they sent
- **Silent**: Client connection succeeds but receives no data
